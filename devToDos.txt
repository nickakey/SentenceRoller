DONE -  When I open the synonym menu, I also want to be able to close it in case I don't like any of the words
DONE - Error handle if the word is not a valid word... 
DONE - When I click submit without any words, it shouldn't let me do anything
DONE - I want a "New Sentence" button that will take me back to the mainscreen and clear everything
DONE - I want to add more word slots so that I can roll longer sentences
DONE -  Request the synonyms for EVERYTHING right away..


* CSS duh...
* Change it to ONE input field, that splits everything
* On click of a synonym 
    * the synonym field should dissapear
    * the dropdown should populate with synonyms of the new selected word


* There should be a share button that allows me to share the before sentence and the after sentence and a link to the app
* There needs to be better handling where words without synonyms are highlighted red and given the option to change
    * You should also be able to proceed with certain words without them being synonyms. 
    ("there are no synonyms for the words highlighted in red... proceed anyways?");
