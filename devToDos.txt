* When a synonym is chosen, 
  the cursor still needs to be there
  the cursor needs to move to the end of the word
  the synonym list needs to update to match the new word
  
* If you write a new word in the back of other words, how do the synonyms get updated?

* Make a word with synonyms light up green!








DONE - Make the dom render so that every word is in a div!
DONE - Make the thesaurus part actually work!
Write a bunch of tests per that course 
DONE -  When I open the synonym menu, I also want to be able to close it in case I don't like any of the words
DONE - Error handle if the word is not a valid word... 
DONE - When I click submit without any words, it shouldn't let me do anything
DONE - I want a "New Sentence" button that will take me back to the mainscreen and clear everything
DONE - I want to add more word slots so that I can roll longer sentences
DONE -  Request the synonyms for EVERYTHING right away..
DONE - handle words without synonyms
DONE - Have there just be one screen, and you type your words, they get added to the dom as grey, and 
if there are no synonyms, they turn red, but if there ARE syonyms they turn green. That all happens
asynchronously. 
DONE - Change it to ONE input field, that splits everything

* CSS duh...
  * Make the hint words fade in and out
  * When a new synonym is chosen, have some sort of visual effect to show a Change
