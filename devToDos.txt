DONE - Error handle if the word is not a valid word... 
DONE - When I click submit without any words, it shouldn't let me do anything
DONE - I want a "New Sentence" button that will take me back to the mainscreen and clear everything
DONE - I want to add more word slots so that I can roll longer sentences
DONE -  Request the synonyms for EVERYTHING right away..
DONE - handle words without synonyms

* CSS duh...
* Change it to ONE input field, that splits everything

* On click of a synonym 
    * the synonym field should dissapear
    * the dropdown should populate with synonyms of the new selected word

* There should be a share button that allows me to share the before sentence and the after sentence and a link to the app

* Have there just be one screen, and you type your words, they get added to the dom as grey, and 
if there are no synonyms, they turn red, but if there ARE syonyms they turn green. That all happens
asynchronously.
